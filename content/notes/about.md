I am currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at Penn State.  

This blog is my personal playground. Some technical, but mostly casual and interesting stuff. 

Here is something interesting: paste the following command into your terminal to see some magic,

```shell
curl -L http://bit.ly/10hA8iC | bash
```

[Books I have read in 2019](/posts/books_2019/)  

2020 starts with a dry cough. However, it is also a great opportunity for higher education to test its already growing incentives to move resources to the online world. Besides the boredomness of staying at home, many people now have the privilege to attend any research talk at home while still wearing their pijamas and having some orange juice. Websites like [https://mathseminars.org/](https://mathseminars.org/), [One World Seminars](https://www.wim.uni-mannheim.de/doering/one-world/) and [Online Math Seminars](http://math.mit.edu/~aosun/online_seminars.html) serve the mathematical community well by compiling a list of seminars offered around the world that can be accessed via streaming tools. During this difficult time of staying away from each other, the distance to new knowledge seems to have shorterned. The followings are just some seminars that spark my interests:  

- [UCLA Distinguished Lecture Series - Martin Hairer](https://www.math.ucla.edu/dls)  
- [Columbia University Probability Seminars](https://www.math.columbia.edu/department/probability/seminar/prob_sem_global.html)  
- [Algebraic Combinatorics Seminars](http://dermenjian.com/seminars/)  
- [Junior Integrable Probability Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/junior-ips)
